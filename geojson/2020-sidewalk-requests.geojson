Three years ago the city installed a new sidewalk on the south west quadrant of Kinser Pike and the 46/45 Bypass. A black fabric erosion barrier was installed and never removed. This eyesore has been in place since the completion of the project. The State of Indiana is unable to mow this area because of the obstruction. It would be nice if the city would remove this so it can once again be mowed. According to the city this area is part of the \"scenic gateway corridor\" to Bloomington. For the past few years it has been anything but scenic. Thank you for taking a look at this situation. Regards,  Jeff Stevens, Owner, Harley-Davidson of Bloomington  812-333-8300"

While Blue Ridge has many positive aspect, unfortunately walkability and biking accessibility to the rest of Bloomington is not one. Dunn Street is narrow, with low visibility hampered by hills, and College Avenue has high-speed traffic. Bloomington Mass Transit does not serve our neighborhood. These factors combine to make walking or biking into or out of Blue Ridge a challenge. It would be of great benefit to our neighborhood if some means could be found to connect our neighborhood via sidewalks to the rest of Bloomington and give our 220 households a means to safely access Bloomington other than by car.\r\n\r\nWith that goal in mind, we request consideration of a sidewalk on North Dunn Street connecting SR 45/46 to Tamarack and ultimately Lakewood Drive. \r\n \r\nWe thank you for considering this matter."

But once I get to the part of Woodlawn that borders Bryan Park, I am loathe to get myself onto the park trail during my hasty commute for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The Bryan Park trail is a park trail, not a sidewalk.\r\n\r\n2. This trail doesn't go straight northward, so it is a waste of my time to follow it.\r\n\r\n3. My commute is at 7:15am when few people are out, making things unnecessarily scary for trail users when I'm quickly approaching them from behind.  This is especially true during colder months when it is dark out, and also when I'm carrying my umbrella, which looks not unlike some sort of a weapon.  (Its just an Ikea umbrella.)\r\n\r\nThis morning I was yelled at for the second time by another motorist who was displeased with my choosing to walk on Woodlawn Avenue northbound past Bryan Park.  \"There's a sidewalk over there!\" he shouted.  I had wanted to correct him and point out that its a park trail, but I didn't.  Who knows which maniac who shouts at pedestrians from their car isn't more dangerous, you know?\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there were a sidewalk that ran alongside Woodlawn Avenue past Bryan Park.  I'm not the only person who chooses to walk up the road instead of the park trail, but I admit that there are not many of us, at least at 7:15am.\r\n\r\nLet me end by saying that I am not holding out hope for a sidewalk; this probably isn't a great concern for the city.  But I can't guarantee that annoyed motorists will convince me to change my path, either.\r\n\r\nIn any case: thank you for reading and considering my request.  Have a nice day.\r\n\r\nNicholas Roberts"

The way they were done for the newer S Dunn street houses is great with the recessed street parking.  Why can't one of Bloomington's oldest neighborhoods have decent sidewalks?"

        "description": "Thank you in advance for reading my inquiry. I would like to suggest a sidewalk due to a safety concern that effects children and disabled persons. Referring to the intersection at E Rogers Road and the Stands Drive. There is no sidewalk along this street connecting the stands road sidewalk to the crosswalk at the roundabout a the bottom of the hill (i.e., the area on the south side of E Rogers Road). Moreover, the sidewalk on the other side of the street is completely inaccessible for those with impaired motor function or wheelchairs (there is a large hill with steps only and no ramp). There are two major concerns here: (1) there is no possible way for a disabled person with a wheelchair to travel on E Rogers road (from the roundabout at the bottom of the hill up to the stands drive). (2) There is no way for families and children to safely walk to Child's elementary from this location (the Stands dr). Given that E Rogers road is a busy street with limited visibility for drivers and no crosswalk exists at the intersection of  the Stands drive and E Rogers Road, it is extremely dangerous for children and families that wish to walk their children to the designated elementary school - Child's Elementary. This is the only direct walking path to Child's Elementary for all of the constituents that leave in the Stands neighborhood. There is no sidewalk on the south side of E Rogers Rd to connect the Stands Dr with the crosswalk at the bottom of the hill at the roundabout. Several constituents have expressed a safety concern. I also witnessed one woman and child almost get hit by a car at this busy intersection as they attempted to cross the street. I'd be happy to answer any additional questions. Thank you for reviewing my request."

There are no sidewalks on my walk from Brownstone Terrace to the stadium which forces me to walk on the side of the road, where student drivers who don't pay attention swerve around me at the last second. Additionally when the weather is bad, I'm even forced to walk in the road, putting myself at risk to get hit by a car. I'm also proposing more off campus lighting & would love to meet with someone about these issues to come up with an effective plan. It's unsafe walking home from a late night class or to an early morning class & not being able to see your surroundings. Some of the city lights don't even work. If more light poles were installed, it would reduce the off campus crime rate. The city of Bloomington, not IU, is reponsible to address these issues because it's there property."
