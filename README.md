# Mapping Transportation Equity in Bloomington Indiana

Exploring Maps related to Transportaton Equity in Bloomington, Indiana

## About

The goal of this project is to pull together various data sources relateds to transportation
equity in Bloomington Indiana. Each data source will be represented on a map layer here
that can be toggled on and off.

The maps can then help inform analysis and decisions at the intersection of transportation
and equity in Bloomington, Indiana

## Located Data Sources

The following public data sources have been located in GeoJSON format.

 * [City Council District Boundaries](https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/city-council-district-maps) ([GeoJSON](http://bloomington.in.gov/geoserver/publicgis/ows?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=publicgis:CityCouncilDistricts&outputFormat=application/json))
 * [Bicycle And Pedestrian On Road Bike Facilities](https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/bicycle-and-pedestrian-on-road-bike-facilities-gis-data) ([GeoJSON](https://bloomington.in.gov/geoserver/publicgis/ows?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=publicgis:BikeLanesRoutes&outputFormat=application%2Fjson))

## Desired Data Sources

We're interested in public sources of the following data, ideally available in GeoJSON format.

 * Census district boundaries
* [Neighborhood Boundaries](https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/individual-neighborhood-maps)
 * [Existing Sidewalk Infrastructure](https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/sidewalk-maps)
 * [Racial/density map by census district](http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org/)
   * [Racial demographic dot-density map](https://observablehq.com/@aboutaaron/racial-demographic-dot-density-map) describes to build a racial dot map for specific city. Their
     solution produces a more flexible result, allowing you select just which combinations of race categories you want to display.
 * [Income Map](http://www.city-data.com/income/income-Bloomington-Indiana.html)
 * [Motor Vehicle / Ped Crash Density Map](https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/05.22.2019%20Transportation%20Plan%20Council%20Approved%20edits_0.pdf#page=20&zoom=280,-207,624). Currently on page
 * [Motor Vehicle / Bike Crash Density Map](https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/05.22.2019%20Transportation%20Plan%20Council%20Approved%20edits_0.pdf#page=21&zoom=280,-207,624). Currently on page
 21 of the Transportation Plan
 * [Planned Bicycle Facilities Network](https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/05.22.2019%20Transportation%20Plan%20Council%20Approved%20edits_0.pdf#page=47&zoom=280,-207,792). Currently in the Transportation Plan. Page 47.
 * [Priority Bicycle Facilities Network](https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/05.22.2019%20Transportation%20Plan%20Council%20Approved%20edits_0.pdf#page=48&zoom=280,-207,737). Page 48. These are the bike projects most likely to be funded and built in the next 6 years.
 * Locations and other details of sidewalk projects funded by the Sidewalk Committee
 * Locations and other details of sidewalk projects recommended by the Transportation and Planning
   department, whether they were funded or not.
 * [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/) (not public but a free tier of use is available)


## Milestones

See the Issue Tracker to track sub-tasks and milestones for this project.

The first big goal for the project is a "sidewalk equity audit".  We'll
look at sidewalks recently approved for funding by the Sidewalk Committee as
well as those recommended by the Transportation and Planning Department that might
not have been approved.

The sidewalk project data will be looked at in the context of the other related data sources above.


## Related 

 * [Bloomington Sidewalk Committee](https://www.bloomington.in.gov/council/sidewalks) is a
   four-member subset of the City Council that decides on how sidewalk funds
   are spent. They are advised by the Planning and Transportation Department,
   which
   analyzes the projects with several objective metrics, but the group is not required to follow
   the objective metrics and may fund projects not on the list at all. For example, after
   recently funding a crosswalk for a cul-de-neighborhood on Moore's Pike, the most
   recent meeting funded another cross walk across Moore's Pike, supporting another
   10 household cul-de-sac, despite there being neighborhoods with many more homes elsewhere in
   the City that have sub-par sidewalk facilities.
